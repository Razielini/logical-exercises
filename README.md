- Maskify: Given a credit card number, mask parts of it in order to obfuscate the full number while
keeping the card identifiable. The resulting string should have the majority of the credit
card number masked except for the ​first and the last four digits​. If the given string has
less than 7 characters, none should be masked.

- Ordinal Numbers: Given any cardinal number (positive integer), return the [​ordinal​​](https://www.ego4u.com/en/cram-up/vocabulary/numbers/ordinal) equivalent as a string,
according to english rules.
(For 0 as an input, return "0").

- Reverse Polish Notation: Given a string that contains a mathematical expression in [​reverse polish notation​](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation),
evaluate the expression and return the result as integer.
